I'm an R Markdown document! 

# Section 1

Here's a **code chunk** that samples from 
a _normal distribution_:

```{r}
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

# Section 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `r mean(samp)`.

# Section 3

This is going to be a plot! First I generate a data frame and then use 'ggplot' to make a plot.

```{r}
plot_df =
  tibble(
   x= rnorm(n=1000),
   y= 1 + 2* x + rnorm(n=1000)
  )


```
